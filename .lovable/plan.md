# Update Landing Page Donation Text to "Option E"

## Scope
Only the **landing page** donation section and its popup. No changes to in-app translations or the in-app `DonationPopup`.

## Changes

### 1. `src/components/landing/SupportSection.tsx`
Update the hardcoded English text:

- **Heading (line 15):** "Free forever" → "Honest software, community funded"
- **Body (lines 18-21):** → "I built Convy because I needed it - open source, no ads, no tracking. It's free forever, but if it's been useful to you, even a small tip means the world."
- **Button (line 30):** "Support Convy" → "Leave a tip"

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/landing/SupportSection.tsx` -- heading, body, button text
